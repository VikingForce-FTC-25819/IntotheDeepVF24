 * This is a simple OpMode to understand how the odometry pods can be used to navigate based on
 * distance traveled.  We can use this OpMode to score a potential of 5 points.  2 by pushing a
 * preloaded sample to the net zone, then 3 by backing up to the observation zone.
 *
 * The OpMode is designed to
 * 1. Wait for a period of time defined by INITIAL_PAUSE_SECONDS
 * 2. Accelerate forward for a distance of FORWARD_DISTANCE_INCHES
 * 3. Stop all the motors
 * 4. Wait for a period of time defined by TRANSITION_PAUSE_SECONDS
 * 5. Accelerate backward for a distance of BACKWARD_DISTANCE_INCHES
 * 6. Stop all the motors
